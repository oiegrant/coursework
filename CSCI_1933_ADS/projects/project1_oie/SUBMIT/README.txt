How to compile:
Have the files Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java, Canvas.java, and FractalDrawer.java in
the same directory (or ensure they have access to one another).

Compile all of the above listed java files.

Running FractalDrawer will provide you with a basic shell UI to pick the shape for fractalization.


Assumptions:
Assuming that user has relevant JDK installation


Additional features implemented:
public Color randomColor() (inside FractalDrawer)
 - This selects a random pastel color for each layer of the fractals
public double getArea() (inside FractalDrawer)
 - This returns the Area accumulator variable so that it can be displayed in main as requested


Known bugs:
- The full fractal doesnt seem to load unless you double click on the header bar of the canvas window (and takes some time)
- The display generation gets very slow at around 10 layers
